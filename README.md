## I made a Balance Wheel!
Hi, I just want to understand myself well, so I decided to take a coaching.
My Coach said that you'd better to write a Balance Wheel, so I made it by p5js, the basic language.
I don't know well about git hub, I don't know how to clone or make branch but it's really dull to start everything perfectly, so I decided to 
release my project now.

I made this!
